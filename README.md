The human skeleton is the internal framework of the human body. It is composed of around 270 bones at birth â€“ this total decreases to around 206 bones by adulthood after some bones get fused together. The bone mass in the skeleton reaches maximum density around age 21. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton)
